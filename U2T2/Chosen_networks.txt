The following networks were chosen to work with:
1. Citation networks : nodes represent papers, edges represent citations
2. Collaboration networks : nodes represent scientists, edges represent collaborations (co-authoring a paper)
3. Online communities : data from online communities such as Reddit and Flickr
4. User actions : actions of users on social platforms.
5. Graph classification datasets : disjoint graphs from different classes
